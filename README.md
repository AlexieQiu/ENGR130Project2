Vehicle mission requirements. The Autonomous Vehicle (AV) will perform two missions. The
first will be to navigate a sector track with only the known obstacles shown on the sector map.
See Figure 2. There will be no physical objects on the track other than a thin piece of cardboard
indicating a potential barrier. The AV will navigate from a known start location to a target
location.
